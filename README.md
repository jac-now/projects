Just some projects I've created in the past.

DL-Bulk-Import.ps1 requires variables to be configured as needed. Uses CSV files to bulk import mail contacts for external users, as well as CSV to add users to a DL

hostscan.ps1 scans a /24 network for hosts and tries to resolve the hostname. Subnet should be configured to the required subnet

ipscan.ps1 a quicker version of the above that does not include hostname resolution.

expenses.py a simple budget calculator in desperate need to improvement (my first coding project)

magic8ball.py you provide a question, and the magic 8 ball decides if it's a good idea or not

passwordgenerator.py generates a simple password consisting of an adjective and a noun with a special character delimiter and a random number added to the end. Looking to add more functionality to this in the near future.

emailmodifier.py generates email addresses with a + string appended to assist in the creation of unique logins and determine source of email leaks. Looking to make a PowerShell variant.
